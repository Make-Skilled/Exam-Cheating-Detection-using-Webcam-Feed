## Troubleshooting

### Webcam Access Issues

If you encounter webcam access problems:

1. **Permission Denied**: Ensure your application has permission to access the webcam
2. **Webcam in Use**: Close other applications that might be using the webcam
3. **Driver Issues**: Update your webcam drivers
4. **Multiple Webcams**: If you have multiple cameras, try changing the index in `cv2.VideoCapture(0)` to `cv2.VideoCapture(1)` or higher

### OpenCV Installation Issues

If you have trouble installing OpenCV:

```bash
# Alternative installation methods
pip install opencv-python-headless  # Headless version (no GUI)
# or
conda install opencv  # If using Anaconda
```

### MediaPipe Installation Issues

If you encounter MediaPipe installation problems:

```bash
# Alternative installation methods
pip install mediapipe-silicon  # For Apple Silicon Macs
# or
conda install -c conda-forge mediapipe  # If using Anaconda
```

### PyTorch Installation Issues

If you encounter PyTorch installation problems:

```bash
# Alternative installation methods
conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch  # If using Anaconda
# or visit https://pytorch.org/ for platform-specific installation
```

### YOLOv5 Model Download Issues

If the YOLOv5 model fails to download:

1. **Check internet connection**
2. **Manual download**: The model will be downloaded to `~/.cache/ultralytics/`
3. **Alternative models**: You can specify different YOLOv5 models:
   - `yolov5n.pt` (nano - fastest, smallest)
   - `yolov5s.pt` (small - default)
   - `yolov5m.pt` (medium)
   - `yolov5l.pt` (large)
   - `yolov5x.pt` (extra large - most accurate)

### Flask Web App Issues

If you encounter Flask application problems:

1. **Port already in use**: Change the port in `run_flask.py` or `app.py`
2. **Template not found**: Ensure `dashboard.html` is in the `templates/` directory
3. **Module not found**: Install Flask with `pip install flask`

## Performance Tips

- **Detection Confidence**: Adjust `min_detection_confidence` in the code (default: 0.5) for different sensitivity levels
- **Model Selection**: Use `model_selection=0` for short-range detection or `model_selection=1` for full-range detection
- **Frame Processing**: The application processes every frame for real-time detection
- **Warning Frequency**: Console warnings are printed for each frame with multiple faces detected
- **Head Pose Sensitivity**: Adjust the angle thresholds in the code for different sensitivity levels:
  - Yaw threshold: ¬±15¬∞ (left/right detection)
  - Pitch threshold: ¬±10¬∞ (up/down detection)
- **Eye Tracking Sensitivity**: Adjust these parameters for different sensitivity levels:
  - EAR threshold: 0.21 (blinking detection sensitivity)
  - Gaze threshold: 0.3 (screen focus detection sensitivity)
  - Eyes off screen threshold: 5.0 seconds (alert timing)
- **Object Detection Performance**: Adjust these parameters for different performance levels:
  - Object detection interval: 10 frames (process every 10th frame)
  - Object alert threshold: 3.0 seconds (alert timing)
  - Objects of interest: Customize the list for your specific needs
- **Web Dashboard Performance**: 
  - Status updates every 1 second (configurable)
  - Automatic cleanup of old alerts and logs
  - Responsive design for optimal performance

## Exam Cheating Detection Logic

The system implements comprehensive cheating detection by:
1. **Monitoring face count** in real-time
2. **Alerting when multiple faces** are detected (potential collaboration)
3. **Tracking head orientation** to detect distractions or looking away from screen
4. **Monitoring eye movements** to detect looking away from screen
5. **Detecting blinking patterns** for attention monitoring
6. **Detecting suspicious objects** like phones, books, laptops
7. **Providing visual feedback** with color-coded bounding boxes
8. **Logging warnings** to console for monitoring purposes
9. **Measuring precise angles** for detailed analysis
10. **Timing eyes off screen** for extended distraction detection
11. **Timing suspicious object presence** for extended cheating detection
12. **Web-based monitoring** with real-time dashboard updates

### Detection Thresholds

#### Head Pose Detection:
- **Looking Left**: Yaw < -15¬∞
- **Looking Right**: Yaw > 15¬∞
- **Looking Up**: Pitch < -10¬∞
- **Looking Down**: Pitch > 10¬∞
- **Looking Forward**: Within normal ranges

#### Eye Tracking Detection:
- **Blinking**: EAR < 0.21
- **Looking at Screen**: Gaze deviation < 0.3
- **Eyes Off Screen Alert**: > 5.0 seconds

#### Object Detection:
- **Suspicious Objects**: Cell phones, books, laptops, tablets, etc.
- **Object Alert Threshold**: > 3.0 seconds
- **Detection Interval**: Every 10 frames (for performance)

## Console Output Examples
